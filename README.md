### CATALOG OF CIGARETTE PACKS
by Yadira Calzadilla

## Description of the project
The project consists of a demo of a catalog of collector's items (cigarette packs), belonging to the La Honradez factory. Each piece belongs to a series, and it deals with different topics. In addition, there are articles that delve into this topic and that can be consulted on the internet. The application also provides access to them.

For this demo only the following user stories were taken into account in the backlog:
- As an unregistered user I can access the main page and consult general information about the La Honradez factory and its cigarette packs. 
- As a registered user I can access the collection of cigarette packs and carry out searches filtered by the name of the series to which they belong and by topic.
- As a registered user I can access the list of articles published on the internet that delve into the subject.
- As an administrator I can add, delete and modify cigarette packs.
- As an administrator I can add, delete and modify articles.

A registered user also has access to the other two pages of content: Collection, where you can find the collection of packs, from which you can also access to see its details. In the case of the admin, he can access the same as the registered user, but he has modification permissions, so these options will appear visible to him.
